Java implementation of tic tac to practice TDD

# Notes
* It's challenging to start from the inside out. Next time, go from the outside in - starting with the high level game play, 
and then continuing down until you reach the internals.
* Interesting reads about Red Green Refactor - should try this out this week at work. 
* In a more complex example, mocking would be invaluable.
* Did not TDD the integration test - should have done that as well.
